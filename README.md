* In this project, I made the payment screens. 

* Once the payment stages are completed, we can go to the next screen with the "Next" button. 

* When we come to our last page, the "Next" button turns black, this shows us that there is no other stage left.

* This is how my project looks on the homepage.

* Here all the steps are completed. Since there is no other stage left, our "Next" button has been completed and turned black. 

* If we want to check the information we entered, we can press the "Prev" button and return to the previous stages. 

* Do not forget that after the first stage, the "Prev" button will also turn black, as there is no other stage left.
